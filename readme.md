## Project Plan
<x> Decide on renderer: pygame vs p5.py: pygame
<X> Given initial conditions, detect time loops / oscillations
    how many trips until the loop starts?
    how many trips make up the oscillation loop?
<x> Write fast-detect mode that skips render and stops once it detects a time loop
< > Write data collection script to answer early questions

## Open Questions
1. How often do perfect time loops happen?
2. How often to time oscillations happen?
3. Do these vary based on the rule?
4. Do these vary based on the portal size?
5. Do these vary based on the portal time / distance?
